# [Hercules](https://github.com/RandomByte/hercules) - Random Home Automation Stuff on Kubernetes

ðŸš§ Work in progress.

**All Docker images used in this project are built for the armhf architecture (Raspberry Pi et al.) only.**  
However, it should be fairly easy to set this up on any other architectures, you just need to build the Docker images yourself.


## Prerequisites
1. Have a running Kubernetes cluster on one or more Raspberry Pis
	- *The Docker images used in this project currently only support the Pis armhf architecture*
	- I highly recommend checking [this repository](https://github.com/alexellis/k8s-on-raspbian) for information on how setting up Kubernetes on Raspbian.
	- Personally I use [k3s](https://k3s.io/)
1. [Helm](https://helm.sh/) v3

## Usage
1. Clone this repository and navigate into it
    ``` sh
    git clone https://github.com/RandomByte/hercules.git
    cd hercules
    ```
1. Copy the file `prod-values.yaml.example` to `prod-values.yaml`:  
	``` sh
	cp prod-values.yaml.example prod-values.yaml
	```

1. In the file `prod-values.yaml`, replace all variables with the appropriate values
	- `<external ip>`: Enter the external IP address of one of your nodes (preferably the 'master'), that should be used by external services to communicate with the MQTT and other servers within your cluster

1. Create a helm release named "hercules" and deploy it via kubectl
	``` sh
	helm install -f prod-values.yaml hercules .
	```

## Uninstall
As easy as:

```sh
helm uninstall hercules
```

## Modules
Modules that are either running within the Kubernetes cluster or on external devices such as sensors. Communication happens via MQTT.
